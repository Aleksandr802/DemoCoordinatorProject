Coordinator pattern.
This pattern might be for you if you want to write a Swift app with a very flexible architecture which is modular and scalable.
I will show you a nice example with different app flow scenarios. 
I use Combine to pass data between different Coordinators. 
I am also including MVVM (Model-View Model-View). 
In this demo project I share the same view model between 2 different view/view controllers.
